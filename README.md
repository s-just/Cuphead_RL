# Cuphead_RL
Implementation of a DQN and object recognition to play a boss level in Cuphead. (This is a complete rebuild that I did myself of a previous project from my senior course at KSU: https://github.com/s-just/SP-14-RL)

I have included pre-trained weights that were used to beat the slime boss with 3hp and the boomerang weapon. Training for other weapons seems to take more time and a more complicated reward system.

There is a video of this agent defeating the boss.
