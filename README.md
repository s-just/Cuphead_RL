# Cuphead_RL
Implementation of a DQN and object recognition to play a boss level in Cuphead.

I have included pre-trained weights that were used to beat the slime boss with 3hp and the boomerang weapon. Training for other weapons seems to take more time and a more complicated reward system.

There is a video of the weights provided defeating the boss.
